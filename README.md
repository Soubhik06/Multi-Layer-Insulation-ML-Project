# Multi-Layer-Insulation-ML-Project
#This project demonstrates how Genetic Algorithms (GA) can be used to optimize the thickness of multiple insulation layers in order to minimize heat loss.
Itâ€™s a practical example of how AI techniques can be applied in thermal engineering to improve energy efficiency.
